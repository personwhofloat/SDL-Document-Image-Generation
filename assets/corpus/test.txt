New
data
released by
the European Space Agency (ESA)
reveals
that
our geomagnetic field
is weakening by
around 5% a year
which is
nearly ten times faster than
previous estimates
Furthermore
this effect
not
uniform over the Earth
the field
is weakening faster
in some places
For example
the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA)
a large depression
the Earth's magnetic field
characterized by
values of geomagnetic field
intensity
around 30%
lower than
expected
those latitudes
This
region
covers
a large area
in
the South Atlantic Ocean
and
South America
According to
Swarm satellite
monitoring
results
Earth's magnetic poles
may be
getting ready to flip
has weakened by
about 3.5%
at high latitudes
over
North America
while
has strengthened
about 2%
over Asia
where
is weakest
the South Atlantic Anomaly
has moved steadily
westward
weakened
further
by about 2%
between 1999 and May 2016
Previous
studies
have suggested that
the mosquito
an insect
sensitive to
the magnetic field
the weakening
have increased
reproductive speed
spatial density
promoting
rapid spread of 
mosquito-borne arboviruses.

Thus, we make the bold suggestion that a surveillance of magnetic field may serve as a potential warning of future mosquito-borne arboviruses. Together with other epidemiological data such information might prove to be a useful factor for strategic disease control planning of mosquito-borne arboviruses.
